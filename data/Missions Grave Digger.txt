Pilots are being asked to wait with their ships until the checks are complete. As you look about the port you spot Charles Atinoda supervising a squad of guards. On second thought, it looks more like the guards are questioning him. He looks tense and frustrated.`

The hangar security systems were damaged and the entire squad of guards who had been assigned to protect the ship were killed by the thieves. Whoever did this must be highly skilled professionals."`
