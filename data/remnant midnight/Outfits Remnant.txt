	description `The still living organ of some unknown alien creature throbs and quivers aboard the Ember Nightmare. Integrated into the ships systems, it is not clear how this is kept alive. But the system data does indicate that its primary purpose involves providing the ship with a crude form of stealth via radar and optical jamming. If removed through conventional means, the organ would probably die.`

	description `This modified version of the Inhibitor Cannon lacks the firing synchronization of the standard Remnant version. The result is that instead of firing a volley of inhibitor projectiles, a group of these weapons will produce a steady stream. Intimate knowledge of how the weapon works is necessary to make this sort of modification while leaving the weapon's other attributes unchanged.`
