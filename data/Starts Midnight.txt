	description `You grew up on New Boston, an uninteresting world in the Dirt Belt. You've dreamed of owning a starship ever since your first visit to the spaceport at the age of fifteen. After many long years of working at a textile mill, you've finally saved enough credits to apply for a pilot's license from the Republic.`
	description `	Recently your uncle passed away and left you a ship... Along with a massive pile of debt tied to it.`

	`The law office's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming metal. A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The estate processor, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to inherit, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when you reach the final page. Sign here." He grins.`
	`	You sign your name one final time:`

		`	"Why are all the numbers red?"`
	scene "outfit/schematics"
	`	"Ah, those would be the debts you've inherited," he answers. "900,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 0.4%, which means that your daily payments are 4,693 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 812,945 credits in interest."`
	`	It takes a moment for you to realize he's not joking.`
	``
	`	The elevator is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you back in the lobby. But as you step outside the law offices, you forget your troubles and start smiling. Parked before you is the Blood Rage, your ticket to getting off this planet.`
	choice

	scene "outfit/energy cannon"
	`	You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel; wonderful smells. You note the guns mounted on the ship are two different sizes. The larger one is an Energy Cannon, a brutal relic from a war that occured long ago. Hopefully you won't have to actually kill someone with this...`

			`Representation in the Republic Parliament is based on population. That means that some individual "Paradise Worlds" have more representatives than entire regions of space like the Dirt Belt that are more sparsely settled.`
		log "Factions" "Syndicate" `The Syndicate is a megacorporation, the largest employer in human space. People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation.`
			`The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses.`
		log "Factions" "Pirates" `In poorer and more remote star systems, where the Navy seldom patrols, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space.`
