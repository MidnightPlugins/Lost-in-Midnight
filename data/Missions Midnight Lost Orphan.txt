			`	"Carabaos like the Halcyon have robust autopiloting systems." You feel intense pressure on your limbs as several bones snap. "Humans were wise to be distrustful of that technology." The pain spreads to your torso as several internal organs burst. "With it, I managed to trick those other Quarg into thinking I'd died." You feel intense pain building up in your head. "But that left me without a ship. Thank you Captain <first> <last>, for coming to my rescue." Like a puppet with its strings severed, your lifeless body crumples to the ground.`
