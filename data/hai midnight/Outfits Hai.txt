	description "A pair of modified heavy pulse pistols favored by some Unfettered and the occasional pirate captain. Dual wielding them adds another gun during short raids against a ship's defenders. Individually, they lose their energy charge more quickly than a pulse rifle, making them a poor choice for holding a defensive position during a long siege."

	description "This Quantum Key Blade is an ancient Hai artifact from the era when their people still waged war on other alien races across the galaxy. The blade is forged from a single Quantum Key Stone of the highest quality. A design of the micro circuitry in the hand grip, the technological secrets of which have been lost to antiquity, sends a charge through the blade that alters the wielder's quantum alignment, granting the ability to walk through walls or other solid matter."
