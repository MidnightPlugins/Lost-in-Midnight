			`	But then she leans in and whispers conspiratorially, "There are rumors that Han Sizer got ahold of some alien device, like the ones the Quarg use instead of a Hyperdrive. Supposedly the government confiscated it after he died." She leans back, "But whether that's true or not, who can say?" She smiles mishieviously and you wonder if that's just a story they tell museum guests to enhance the legend of Han Sizer.`
