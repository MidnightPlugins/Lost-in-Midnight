This can make energy usage by certain outfits more efficient while also alleviating effects that would drain your energy reserves. A skilled engineering crew who understands how these systems work and interact with each other is essential to Engineering Room operations."
	description "	Engineering Rooms are also often the location where a ship's self-destruct sequence is activated. Typically it involves deliberately causing a reactor meltdown in the ship's power systems or some similar catastrophic failure. At a minimum, this usually requires the cooperation of both the captain and the engineering crew."
