From a distance, it looks like someone duct taped an energy blaster to the side of a civilian science drone. Upon closer inspection, that assessment isn't too far off. Each drone has minor differences in construction materials and how the wires are routed. Few pirates actually use these, but the ones who do tend to buy them in bulk."

This design crams all of the ship's gun ports into a single central location, allowing multiple smaller guns to emulate the effect of having a single larger one. This negatively impacts the ship's cooling efficiency and increases the amount of work maintenance crews have to put in for guns not mounted on the edge of the cluster."
