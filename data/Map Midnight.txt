It wasn't long before the station attracted the attention of pirates. After being captured, it remained under pirate control until shortly after the foundation of the Republic.`
	description `	When the Navy began its crackdown on pirate activities, Eureka Station was among the first of the outlaw havens to fall. After the Republic established control of the station, attempts were made to restart deuterium processing operations. Those plans came to an end with the Alpha war. The battle of Ipsing brought about the station's final downfall. A barrage of rocket fire sent Eureka out of its established orbit. Since then it has remained an uninhabited derelict, slowly drifting towards the system's edge.`
	spaceport `The damage that destroyed any hope of returning Eureka to its former glory has caused many sections of the station to either lack an atmosphere or be flooded with toxic chemicals released from the fuel processing equipment. Due to a malfunction in the environmental controls, the temperature in the few habitable areas is also near freezing. You can search the station for leftover fuel, but be wary of sealed doors that could lead to the open void or other hazards.`

	landscape land/midnight-sivael5
	music ambient/saloon
	description `During the early days of humanity's expansion into space, the success of a pirate base was determined more by its ability to remain hidden than on the strength of a defensive fleet. Rum Cellar is one of those early success stories, thanks to the alien device orbiting Chasm's sun. The pirates who first found the abandoned artifact quickly learned how to use it to shut down the hyperspace link to the system. This allowed Chasm to remain a secret out of reach from authoritarian governments.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a ring of docking bays that circle around the station. Not everyone here is a pirate. There are also those who conduct business with pirates arriving and departing.`

	music ambient/derelict
	description `The technology and architecture of this abandoned station reminds you of the Wanderers. Could they have built it? It would mean they occupied this part of the galaxy some time in the distant past.`
	description `There might be something here worth salvaging if you look hard enough. You just have to sift through a lot rusted decaying junk first. Whoever lived here in the past seemed to leave in a panicked rush. Judging from the condition of the station, the evacuation was chaotic and disorganized.`
	spaceport `Although most of the spaceport is empty, there are a surprising amount of ships still docked here. However, a more thorough examination reveals that most are likely not in working condition.`

	landscape land/desert0ver8
	description `Mining outposts dot the surface of this dry desert world. The planet looks deserted while everyone takes shelter from the sun during the heat of the day. But after sunset the mines are crawling with activity.`
	description `	Most Vesta miners are descendants of refugees from the Alpha War who were granted sanctuary by the pirate lords of Janus. While they aren't slaves, they are expected to pay tribute for "protection". While some resent being born into this way of life, most here accept it.`
	spaceport `The landing strip ends with a gigantic tunnel that allows ships to be parked underground. Much of the rest of the spaceport consists of a series of tunnels and artificially constructed caverns.`

	landscape land/midnight-sivael4
	music ambient/guzheng
	description `The pirates who discovered this isolated system, and the secrets to using the alien device orbiting its sun to activate and deactivate the hyperspace links leading to the system, created this space station as a rest stop for those seeking refuge from Earth's authority. It also serves as a meeting place for those seeking to do business with the underworld or rival pirate factions in need of neutral ground.`
	description `	Control of the station has switched hands several times over the centuries. Most of the previous transfers of power were violent. However, the current administration, an organization known as the Red Dragons, bought its way in. They are an independent consortium involved in instellar smuggling operations throughout the galaxy.`
	spaceport `Many of the pirate ships parked here are being repaired. It's a wonder some of them were able to escape the Navy in the condition that they are in.`
