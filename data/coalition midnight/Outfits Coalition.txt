	description "This is a Modified Blaster that has been disguised to resemble a Coalition Model Cannon. Some scanning interference is built into the weapon to help conceal its internal circuitry. These weapons are popular with both criminals and dissidents within the Coalition, allowing them to covertly arm their ships without drawing attention from the Heliarchs."

	description "This is a turreted version of the Camouflaged Blaster, which is a Quad Mod Blaster that has been disguised to resemble a Coalition Model Cannon. Due to the size differences, there is space within the weapon for even more scanning interference material. With enough of these turrets covering a ship, one can more easily sneak illegal cargo through Heliarch checkpoints."

	description `Culminator Torpedoes are an antique design that eventually lead to development of the modern Finishers in use by the Heliarch. Old forgotten weapons caches of these are sometimes found hidden throughout Coalition space.`
	description `	Unlike Finishers, Culminators launch hot. This shortens their range since they burn out more quickly.`

	description "A simple crowd control barrier made from the same durable alloys found in spaceship hulls. Easy to set up and difficult to break through, they can be surprisingly effective at blocking passage through the corridors of a ship."
	description "	While Riot Containment Barriers are typically deployed by the Heliarchs to keep civil unrest under control, these are technically not weapons. A growing market of citizens concerned about dissidents is starting to have these installed on their ships."
