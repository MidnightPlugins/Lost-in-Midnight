Along the way, you got to hear some of their music, which is mostly characterized by frenzied instrumentals, a very energetic brass section, and bizarre lyrics. One day while you were in transit, they nearly drove you insane by playing their catchy but nonsensical song "Henhouse In Your Soul" for four hours straight, but other than that they have been good passengers, and their stage manager gives you an incredibly generous payment of <payment>.`
			`	"We've already got a gig lined up for tonight," says Ulrich. "Want to come? We'll give you free tickets." Given how well they just paid you, it might be worth going just to build a relationship with the band, even if not for the music itself.`

			`	The band is even louder in concert than they were when practicing in the confines of your ship. About thirty minutes into the concert, the energy of the crowd and the surreal lyrics finally begin to soak in, and rather than seeming meaningless their music feels fraught with meaning that hovers just beyond your grasp.`
			`	Finally the band announces that their last song will be "Sad Archie." You've never heard of it, but the fans scream in approval. It's a slow, ballad-like song about a man named Archie who lives forever and is sad because the friends he makes all grow old and die. Archie has a pet dragon, and he builds a beautiful house for the dragon, but the dragon dies young. Archie is so sad seeing the dragon's house empty and gathering dust that he rents it out to some friends, but they fight with each other and trash the place. The story makes no sense, but some of the fans are wiping away tears as the song ends.`
			`	Becca, who is sitting next to you in the VIP section, says, "We learned years ago that we need to end every concert with a sad song. Otherwise the fans leave with way too much energy and start destroying public property."`
			`	The concert ends, and you say goodbye to the band. They say they'll be in touch if they ever need a ride again.`

A second after you realize that the whole thing is a thinly veiled critique of the Syndicate, a group up front unrolls a banner that reads "End Wage Slavery!" and begins shouting and chanting slogans.
