	description "A weapon stolen from Farpoint's evidence vault, this bears a resemblance to the Korath Thermal Repeater Rifle. It launches a glob of burning plasma that can melt though titanium on contact. Firing this weapon once to discourage boarders, then switching to a different weapon for raiding the opposing ship is probably how it was meant to be used. It's possible that this is the last one of these weapons to exist. The heat it generates is so intense that it can melt its own components if not given adequate time to cool down."
