# The Nemesis were made with the lore assumption that each Nemesis npc has ventured outside of human space.
# The presence of pirate ships in the Oathbreaker fleet represents their dwindling supplies and reliance on support from pirates.
# The mission features variant NPCs depending on the player's previous mission path choices.

			`You're trying to relax at a bar when suddenly you hear raised voices and shouting outside as pilots run for their ships: "An Oathbreaker fleet has appeared over <planet> and is demanding tribute! The local militia has already been wiped out and the government of <planet> is requesting help from any combat-worthy ship at the spaceport to join the defenses!" The authorities of <planet> will probably pay you quite well if you assist them, but this could also be an easy way to get yourself killed.`

			`	You are the only pilot still on the ground as the battle rages overhead. "Want something to calm the nerves?" asks the bartender. He downs a shot before you have a chance to respond. A loud explosion goes off nearby and you swear to yourself as you look out the window. Your ship has just been hit by a stray missile! You rush outside to check the damage when a shadow falls over you... One of the Oathbreaker carriers is crashing into the spaceport. Flames are leaking from where you'd expect the fission reactor would be located. There's no escaping the impending explosion. As the rapidly descending carrier deteriorates into a ball of flaming death, you idly wonder why you didn't take your own destiny into your hands up in the sky rather than cowering here on the ground.`

			`You're surprised when your warning alarm goes off. There is an Oathbreaker fleet in the system! But they aren't powering up their weapons. One of the ships hails you.`
			`	A woman speaks. "Good day to you, Captain <last>. I am Captain Magna of the Agincourt. We have not forgiven you. However, we are no longer interested in fighting. Not everyone in the Oathbreakers actually swore the oath. In actuality, only a few of the leaders and organizers did. The rest of us just happened to lose friends or family in the war and rallied to Benedict's banner. Eventually, those of us who were not prepared for the toll of fighting a war lost the will to fight. Unfortunately for us, we could no longer go home. When Benedict got his hands on some jump drives, he assigned us to these ships and ordered us to explore the region beyond the rim. We were uncertain of our future at first, but the Coalition has been very welcoming towards us. We will not start a fight with you in the presence of the Heliarch. And we advise you to grant us the same courtesy. Farewell."`
